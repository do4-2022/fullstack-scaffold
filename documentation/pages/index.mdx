# A TODO Application

This scaffolding project expose a typical architecture for a TODO Fullstack application would consist of both front-end and back-end components.

*The Frontend view of the ScalaJS Fullstack Frontend application*

This projects aims to provide a fullstack *Scala Web Application* 
using [ScalaJS](https://www.scala-js.org/), [Zio](https://zio.dev/guides/quickstarts/restful-webservice/), and a way to persist information in at least one database management system.

## A Scaffolding project

In computer science, `scaffolding` refers to a technique or practice used in software development to provide a temporary 
framework or support structure for building applications. 
It is a process of creating a *basic structure* or *skeleton code* 
that helps developers quickly set up the foundation of an application
 or system before adding specific functionalities.

Scaffolding typically involves generating or auto-generating code, *templates*, or frameworks
that provide a starting point for development. 
This can include boilerplate code, directory structures, 
* models, user interfaces, or other components that are commonly needed in an application.
The purpose is to streamline the development process, 
reduce repetitive tasks, and accelerate the initial setup of a project.

Scaffolding tools or frameworks are often used in web development, 
where they can generate basic code templates for creating models, views, 
controllers, database migrations, and other components of a web application. 
These tools enable developers to quickly establish a project's structure and focus on implementing the specific business logic or features without starting from scratch.

Scaffolding can be particularly useful in rapid prototyping, 
where speed is prioritized over fine-grained customization. 
Once the scaffolding is in place, developers can modify or 
extend the generated code to meet the specific requirements of the application.
