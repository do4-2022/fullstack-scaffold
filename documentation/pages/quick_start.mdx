# Getting started

This page will helps you to quickly start developing your Scala Fullstack application. 

<Steps>

### Install the required tools

First, you need to have all the required tools to develop the application. 

üëâ Check the [requirement section](/requirements).


### Build your project

First, let's build your fullstack application üèóÔ∏è

This scaffolding project allows you to **customize** some value.
To do so, you should launch the scaffolding application choice with [g8](https://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/usage.html):

```bash
g8 file://${PWD}/scala-fullstack-scaffold

```

It will outputs some Questions about the configuration of the application:

```bash
This a scaffolded app created with Gitter8 

name [My Fullstack App]: 

```

#### Customization

Subsequent questions permits to define: 

- The name of the project   
*The default value is `My Fullstack App`.*

- The name of the Frontend application  
*The default value is `My Fullstack App frontend`.*

- The name of the Frontend application  
*The default value is `My Fullstack App frontend`.*

- The SBT version used  
*The default value is `latest`.* You can use a semantic defined version.

- The Database used
```bash
postgres=yes
```
<Callout type="info">
By setting the value to `no`, a MongDB Database will be used instead.
</Callout>


Once finished, a new folder `name [My Fullstack App]` will be created, containing the frontend and the backend applications.

Here is the generated folder structure:

```
<project_name>/
‚îú‚îÄ <frontend_name>/
‚îú‚îÄ <backend_name>/

```

Now that the project is setup, you will have to launch both application, let's start with the backend !

### Launch the backend

Run the following command:

```bash
cd ./backend
sbt run 
```

### Launch the frontend

```bash
cd ./frontend
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the project in development
npm run dev
```

Now, open your browser at the following [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and see the magic happen üåü.


### Start coding !

<Callout emoji="‚úÖ">
   Congrats, you're all done for this tutorial !

   You can now start building your own Application.
</Callout>

You are done with the setup, now you can performs some changes to see if everything is working as expected:

Open the `header.scala` file and Change the title with `My Todo` :

```scala filename="header.scala" {10} 
package My_Fullstack_App_frontend.components
import com.raquo.laminar.api.L.{given, *}
import My_Fullstack_App_frontend.events.commandObserver
import My_Fullstack_App_frontend.events.Reload

// header of the app
def header() = {
  div(
    cls("header"),
    h1("Todo"),
    errorMessage(),
    div(
      cls("top-bar"),
      button(
        "reload",
        cls("reload"),
        onClick.mapTo(Reload) --> commandObserver
      )
    ),
    newTodoInput
  )
}

```

Save your file and open the Changes in your browser ü§©

</Steps>

Now, to start play with, you should check how the backend works and how to modify it in [the next section](/going_further)
