## Deploy FSS in production

This tutorial explains how to deploy the Fullstack Scala Application in production with *Docker*.

For this example, we will use [nginx-proxy-manager](https://jc21.com/2018/02/nginx-proxy-manager.html).
The Nginx Proxy Manager is a basic interface for beginners and advanced users to create different types of Hosts to proxy their incoming home network traffic.
This tool will allow us to proxy ingress traffic to specific containers on the host machine, from a understandable UI.

Follow the guide ðŸ¦®

<Steps>

### Create a nginx-proxy-manager container

For this first step, you should define two domain name.
One for the frontend and the other for the backend.

<Callout type="info">
  In this example we will use `example.com` for the frontend and `api.example.com`
</Callout>

Create a folder `nginx-proxy-manager` and paste the following code into a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```docker filename="/nginx-proxy-manager/docker-compose.yml"
version: '3.9'

services:
  nginx-proxy-manager:
    image: jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:2.9.19
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      # Public HTTP Port:
      - '80:80'
      # Public HTTPS Port:
      - '443:443'
      # Admin Web Port:
      - '81:81'
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "/bin/check-health"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 3s
    networks:
      - web-proxy
```docker filename="/nginx-proxy-manager/docker-compose.yml"
[...]
networks:
  web-proxy:
```

Run the container with :
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Now let's launch our application !

### Modify the `docker-compose`

To deploy in production the project, a `docker-compose` file is written at the root of the directory, which exposes the application and 
the chooses database.

We now need to bind the services to the external `nginx-proxy-manager_web-proxy` network.

To do so add an external network.
Get back into your application folder and modify the `docker-compose.yml`:

// TODO: Add the FINAL Docker compose

```docker filename="/My Fullstack App/docker-compose.yml"
[...]
networks:
  nginx-proxy-manager_web-proxy:
    external: true  
```

Change the value of `API_URL` for the value defined in the first step **(api.example.com)** for our example.

Launch the `docker-compose`: 

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Now let's expose our services on Internet

### Expose our application on Internet

### Create Proxy Host

Retrieve your IP:
```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```

Open your browser with the following url: `<IP>:81/`.


#### Add a proxy host for the Frontend

Click on the button `Add Proxy Host`

![Proxy Host Frontend](/proxy_host_front.png)

Add the information:
1. Domain Name:  
The value of the `FRONTEND_URL` Defined in [Step 1.1]().
2. Scheme: `http`
3. Forward Hostname / IP : `http`
4. Forward Port : `3000`

Now let's define the SSL with the following:

![SSL Front](/ssl_front.png)

#### Add a proxy host for the Backend

Click on the button `Add Proxy Host`

Add the information:
1. Domain Name:  
The value of the `API_URL` **(api.example.com)** Defined in [Step 1.2]().
2. Scheme: `http`
3. Forward Hostname / IP : `http`
4. Forward Port : `8080`

Now let's define the SSL with the following:

![SSL Front](/ssl_front.png)


Great ! We now need to define DNS Record.

### Create DNS Record 
The application needs two DNS records to work properly:

1. Frontend
    * Name: `<domain_name>` *example.com*
    * Type: `A`
    * Content: `<your-server-public-ip>`
1. Backend
    * Name: `api.<domain_name>` *api.example.com*
    * Type: `A`
    * Content: `<your-server-public-ip>`

</Steps>


Congrats your application is deployed ðŸ¥³
