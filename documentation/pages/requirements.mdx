# Requirements

To start developing this project, you will need the following tools installed on your computer:

## Scala

- [Scala](https://scala-lang.org/download/3.3.0.html) is a statically typed programming language that seamlessly combines *object-oriented* and **functional programming paradigms**. It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and provides powerful abstractions and expressive syntax. 
With Scala, developers can write concise and scalable code, leverage Java libraries, and build robust applications across various domains.

<Callout type="info">
  Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and declarative style. 
  It encourages the use of functions as first-class citizens and avoids mutable state and side effects. 
  Functional programming promotes writing code that is easier to reason about, test, and maintain. 
  
  
  To learn more about functional programming in Scala, you can refer to the official [Scala documentation](https://docs.scala-lang.org/).

## Sbt
[Sbt (Scala Build Tool)](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) is a popular build tool for Scala projects. It offers a flexible and declarative configuration approach, allowing developers to define project settings, dependencies, and tasks in a concise manner. Sbt provides comprehensive support for compiling, testing, packaging, and running Scala applications, making it an essential tool for managing and automating the build process.

## Giter8
[Giter8](https://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/usage.html) is a simple and lightweight templating tool for generating projects from project templates stored in Git repositories. It allows developers to quickly bootstrap new projects by applying predefined templates, reducing the initial setup time. Giter8 templates provide a consistent project structure and include commonly used libraries, configurations, and best practices, enabling faster project kick-starts.

## Node.JS
[Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.16.0/node-v18.16.0-linux-x64.tar.xz) is a JavaScript runtime built on the V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside the browser, on the server-side. Node.js provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it highly efficient for building scalable and real-time applications. It also offers a rich ecosystem of modules through its package manager, npm, enabling developers to easily integrate third-party libraries and tools into their Node.js applications.

## npm
[npm (Node Package Manager)](https://npmjs.org) is the default package manager for Node.js. It is a vast registry of open-source JavaScript packages that developers can use to enhance their Node.js projects. npm provides a command-line interface and a comprehensive set of tools to manage dependencies, install packages, publish and share code, and handle project configurations. It simplifies the process of integrating external libraries and managing project dependencies, making it an essential tool for Node.js developers.
