It receives requests from the front-end, processes them, interacts with the database, and returns the appropriate response.API (Application Programming Interface): The back-end exposes a set of RESTful or GraphQL APIs that the front-end can consume to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on TODO items. The APIs handle the data validation, authentication, and authorization aspects of the application.\nDatabase: A persistent storage system is needed to store the TODO items. Common choices include relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or non-relational databases like MongoDB.ZIO is used for the REST API.","zio#ZIO":"ZIO is a powerful library for Scala that provides type-safe, composable, and concurrent programming capabilities.\nWith ZIO, you can easily build scalable applications that outperform Scala's Future by a factor of 100.By leveraging the full power of the Scala compiler, ZIO enables you to catch bugs at compile time, ensuring type safety and robustness in your codebase.\nZIO simplifies the development of concurrent applications, eliminating common issues like deadlocks, race conditions, and complexity.It allows you to write sequential code that remains consistent, whether it's executed asynchronously or synchronously. Additionally, ZIO promotes resource-safe practices, preventing resource leaks even in the face of failures.It offers excellent testability, allowing you to inject test services into your application for fast, deterministic, and type-safe testing. ZIO empowers you to build resilient applications that handle errors gracefully and respond to failures locally and flexibly.With its functional programming approach, ZIO enables rapid composition of solutions to complex problems using simple building blocks.","architecture-1#Architecture":"This architecture provides a basic structure for a TODO Fullstack application, but keep in mind that specific implementation details and technologies may vary based on individual preferences, project requirements, and scalability considerations.The architecture consists of a frontend application and a backend built with ZIO and Scala.js.\nThe frontend application provides a user interface for managing TODOs, while the backend exposes an API to interact with the TODOs data.The frontend application, developed with Scala.js, benefits from the seamless integration with ZIO, enabling the use of reactive components and ensuring high-performance.","gitter8#Gitter8":"","frontend-application#Frontend application":"","backend-application#Backend application":"","#":"","authors#Authors":"This project was written by the following:","how-to-start-#How to start ?":"You can start to play with this project with the Quick start."}},"/":{"title":"A TODO Application","data":{"":"This scaffolding project expose a typical architecture for a TODO Fullstack application would consist of both front-end and back-end components.\n\n\nThe Frontend view of the ScalaJS Fullstack Frontend applicationThis projects aims to provide a fullstack Scala Web Application\nusing ScalaJS, Zio, and a way to persist information in at least one database management system.","features#Features":"üöÄ Discover the amazing features of our TODO Application! üåü\nEasy project setup with a ready-to-use Frontend and Backend application.
